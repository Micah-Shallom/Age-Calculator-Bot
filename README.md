# Age Calculator Bot

This is a Slack bot that calculates the age of a user based on the year they were born.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply type the command `/my_yob_is` followed by the year you were born. For example, if you were born in 1990, you would type `/my_yob_is 1990`.

The bot will then calculate your age based on the year you were born and respond with a message containing your age.

## Installation

To install the bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` environment variables to your Slack bot token and app token, respectively.
3. Run the bot using the command `go run main.go`.

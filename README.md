# Age Calculator Bot

This is a Slack bot that calculates the age of a user based on the year they were born.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply type the command `/my_yob_is` followed by the year you were born. For example, if you were born in 1990, you would type `/my_yob_is 1990`.

The bot will then calculate your age based on the year you were born and respond with a message containing your age.
